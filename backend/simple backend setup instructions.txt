### Backend setup

    We need to do three things to get ready, get inside this directory/folder to continue with the below commands, "**aEBackendFromScratch**"

    1. change database settings according to your system, in the db_config_connection.php file in the present in the current directory, which is aEBackendFromScratch
        $servername = "localhost";      => keep this the same mostly
        $username = "root";             => put your mysql username in place of **root**
        $password = "root";             => put your mysql password in place of **root**
        $dbname = "aedb2";       => let this be same,








INSTALL COMPOSER FIRST BEFORE RUNNING THIS COMMAND

    2. after being in the aEBackendFromScratch folder or directory, open command prompt in the same directory, run this command in the command prompt "composer require google/apiclient" once all installed, and it'll take some time to do install this 

        AND if you face a **process-timeout#** issue, mostly gets stuck at 94%

        Close the command prompt and do the thing mentioned below

        in your composer.json file, which will be present in the current directory, or inside this directory here "aEBackendFromScratch", open the composer.json file and delete all code inside it, and paste(just inside the curly braces part, including the curly braces themselves) all of this below

        ```json
        {
            "require": {
                "google/apiclient": "*"
            },

            "scripts": {
                "test": [
                    "Composer\\Config::disableProcessTimeout",
                    "phpunit"
                ]
            }
        }
        ```

        once above code is updated in the composer.json file run the command "composer install" in the command promt opened in the CWD


    3. Once again in the CWD which is **aEBackendFromScratch**, run command **"php -S localhost:8000"**, and the backend is now live at **"http://localhost:8000/"**, although, we don't need to run this in the browser pls ignore this
